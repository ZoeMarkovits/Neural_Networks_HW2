CSC 84020 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning: HW Two, Multilayer Perceptron

In this project we train a multilayer perceptron to predict which of seven classes a crime is in based on features provided by the San Francisco PD including the time that the crime was recorded and where it took place. In absolute terms the model does not achieve a high accuracy, but it outperformed models attempting to solve a similar task on Kaggle.
